[![MagicMirror²: The open source modular smart mirror platform. ](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/raw/master/.github/header.png)](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)

**MagicMirror²** is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the **MagicMirror²** allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant.

[![DockerHub Badge](https://dockeri.co/image/bastilimbach/docker-magicmirror)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bastilimbach/docker-magicmirror/)

# Why Docker? [![Build Status](https://github.com/bastilimbach/docker-MagicMirror/workflows/Docker/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/bastilimbach/docker-MagicMirror/actions?query=workflow%3ADocker)

In some cases, you want to start the application without an actual app window. In this case, you can start MagicMirror² in server only mode by manually running `node serveronly` or using Docker. This will start the server, after which you can open the application in your browser of choice.

# Tags

- `latest` - The [latest stable release](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/releases/latest) of MagicMirror.
- `develop` - Image based on the [`develop`](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/develop) branch.
- `vX.Y.Z`- Specific MagicMirror release. Take a look at the [releases](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/releases) page in the MagicMirror repository to get the correct version number.

> The respective docker images are getting updated daily by a GitHub Actions cron job.

# Run MagicMirror² in server only mode

After a successful [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) you just need to execute the following command in the shell:

```bash
docker run  -d \
    --publish 80:8080 \
    --restart always \
    --volume ~/magic_mirror/config:/opt/magic_mirror/config \
    --volume ~/magic_mirror/modules:/opt/magic_mirror/modules \
    --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    --name magic_mirror \
    bastilimbach/docker-magicmirror
```

# Environment variables
Environment variables can be passed to the docker container using the `--env` flag.

| **Variable** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `TZ` | Let the environment variable TZ reflect the time zone. Without the correct time zone the MagicMirror² calendar or other modules might show the wrong time of an event. Find you time zone here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>   |

# Volumes

| **Volume** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/magic_mirror/config` | Mount this folder to insert your own config into the docker container. If the folder is empty the container will create a default configuration which can be adapted to you likings. |
| `/opt/magic_mirror/modules` | Mount this folder to add your own custom modules into the docker container. If the folder is empty the container will copy the [default modules](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/tree/master/modules/default) from the MagicMirror² repository into the volume. |
| `/opt/magic_mirror/css/custom.css` | Mount this file to add your own custom css into the docker container. <br><br> **Important:** You need to create the file before you run the container. Otherwise Docker will create a `custom.css` folder. |
| `/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro` | Add this to syncronize the time of the host with the docker container. <br><br> **Important:** This is for linux hosts. If you run your docker on other OS, you will need to change this. |

# Build arguments

| **Build variable** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `branch` | Specify a branch or tag of the [MagicMirror repository](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) which should be used for building the image. Default: `master` |

# Config

If you start the container without providing a custom configuration it will create a default config inside the `config` volume if it is empty.
This config can then be adapted to your likings.

To keep passwords and API secrets out of the config file add `.template` as extension to the config file (`config.js.template`) and use shell variable syntax (`${MY_API_TOKEN}`) as placeholder for your secrets in the config file.
Don't forget to pass the template variables as environment to the container.
For example: `--env MY_API_TOKEN=secret-token`
or in docker compose file:
```yml
    environment:
      - MY_API_TOKEN=secret-token
```

If you want to build the configuration by yourself be sure to set the following configuration properties accordingly:

```javascript
var config = {
    address: "0.0.0.0", // Needs to be "0.0.0.0" to make MagicMirror listen on any interface.
    port: 8080, // If you change the port, be sure to also adapt the "--publish" flag in your docker run command. e.g: --publish 80:3000
    ipWhitelist: [] // This is required to allow all IP addresses to access MagicMirror. Can also be set to the docker subnet.
}
```

# Docker compose

If docker-compose is your game, here is an example of such.
It will publish the MagicMirror² server on port 8888.

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  magicmirror:
    container_name: magicmirror
    image: bastilimbach/docker-magicmirror
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ~/magic_mirror/config:/opt/magic_mirror/config
      - ~/magic_mirror/modules:/opt/magic_mirror/modules
    ports:
      - 8888:8080
```

## Remarks

**Time zones**

When it comes to time and time zones, MagicMirror² and the individual modules might use these differently.
The device that presents the generated page must have the correct time and time zones settings as well. The MagicMirror² default clock uses the local device's time zone to render the time.

E.g: If you use a Raspberry Pi to show the generated result of the MagicMirror² docker, set the time zone on the RPi with

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

and choose 'Localisation options'
